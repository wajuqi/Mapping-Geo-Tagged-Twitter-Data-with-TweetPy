In this project, geo-tagged tweets with keywords "thanksgiving" were collected from the midnight of Thanksgiving Day (October 14, 2013) till 6:45 am of the next day and a total of 5716 tweets were gathered.
The collected tweets by hour shows that more people would like to tweet about thanksgiving at around lunch time and the start of Thanksgiving Day (midnight).

The map below shows the distribution of tweets about thanksgiving around the world. Unsurprisingly, most of tweets are from Canada (60%) and 35% of them are from USA. As this day is a traditional Canadian festival, the distribution of tweets in foreign countries may suggest the distribution of Canadians living abroad.

We can also infer that the distribution of Canadians by states in USA. There may be more Canadians in California, Texas, and New York as the map below shows. In terms of Canada, most tweets come from Ontario which may result from the large population. Besides, most tweets are located in population centers such as Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Vancouver.
